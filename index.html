Well my parents told me I should explore a field that interests me, but won't constrict me from changing my career path in the future. I love working with people, so the human aspect of user experience has drawn me in. Moreover, I'm interested in a major that is applicable to multiple jobs. Maybe I won't work exactly with UX in the future, but I know that I could apply it to other career paths within computer science and the humanities. Thus, I see myself and UX design developing a great bond throughout the next few years.</h2>
